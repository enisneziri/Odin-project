        It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
        division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
        the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
        weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
        of either's moiety. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
        so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
        brazed to it. I cannot conceive you. His breeding, sir, hath been at

      <p>
        But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
        elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
        though this knave came something saucily into the
        world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
        fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
        whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
        noble gentleman, Edmund?

        Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
        Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
        In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
        To shake all cares and business from our age;
        Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
        Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,

        Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
        Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
        No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
        As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
        A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
        Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

        Myself an enemy to all other joys,
        Which the most precious square of sense possesses;

        Although the last, not least; to whose young love

        It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
        No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
        That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
        But even for want of that for which I am richer,
        A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
        As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
        Hath lost me in your liking.
